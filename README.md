# Perfect_Pose
The basic goal of “PerfectPose” is to provide standard and correct exercise poses using deep learning. This project focuses on classifying exercises using PoseNet and KNN Classifier. Using such deep learning techniques and algorithms, users can find the ideal way to perform a particular exercise. Users’ exercises can be analyzed using PoseNet, a deep-learning TensorFlow model, and KNN. The proposed system recognizes the discrepancy between actual and target poses and corrects the user with high accuracy by providing real-time message & voice-based output along with the necessary instructions to correct the recognized poses. The application features include counting the number of repetitions of a particular exercise and giving message & voice-based feedback to the users .
